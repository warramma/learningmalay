Welcome to Learning Malay!

Throughout my journey to reconnect with my mother tongue (Malay) I realized there are unfortunately not as many resources for learning it, especially compared to popular languages like Mandarin, German, or French.

After scouring the internet, occasionally losing links, and then having to scour the internet once more for the things I can't quite remember the names of, I've created **Learning Malay**: a collection of all the resources I've found so far and advice on how to learn Malay (and any other language!)
