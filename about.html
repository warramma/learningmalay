        <p>Growing up as an Asian American, it wasn’t always easy to be proud of my Asian heritage. By the time I reached high school I realized I had almost completely forgotten Malay (my mother tongue). As I gained confidence through building relationships and discovering my interest in Computer Science, I decided to relearn Malay, one word at a time.</p>
        <p>Throughout my journey to reconnect with Malay, I was struck by how difficult it could be to find good learning resources for Malay compared to languages like Korean or Japanese. I also struggled to incorporate language learning into my daily life which led me to stop learning Malay for around a year.</p>
        <p>After starting the Odin Project’s web development courses, I was inspired to create a learning hub to help myself learn Malay more effectively. Driven by the prospect, I spent months learning how to learn languages, scouring the internet for resources, and experimenting with different learning methods. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and knowledge I gained from school, reading documentation, and past projects, I created Learning Malay to serve as a hub for those learning Malay.</p>
