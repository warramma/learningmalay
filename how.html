        <h2 id="intro-tbc">Intro</h2>
        <p>Many people before you and I have learned a language successfully. Based on what I've seen, there are many paths, but some things consistent with all are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setting clear goals</li>
            <li>Tracking progress with benchmarks or goals</li>
            <li>Incorporating some form of language learning everyday for at least 15 minutes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, consistency is key here. And for those of us who are super busy (I know I am!!) language learning is still possible. Start slow if you need to, it's your journey</p>
        <h2 id="mindset-tbc">Mindset</h2>
        <h3>Accent worries</h3>
        <p>One reason I didn’t learn Malay for so long was because I was embarrassed when others pointed out my American accent. But when you think about it, an accent is really nothing to be ashamed about is it? If anything, it’s a marker of how hard you’ve worked to learn another language despite the obstacles. When I hear others speak with an accent, I don’t think less of them just because of it, and if you do, you should, frankly, check your bias. Additionally, people are too busy thinking about themselves to worry about your accent. Lastly, practice makes perfect. If you really want to perfect your accent, not practicing because you’re ashamed isn't going to help. Baby steps.
        </p>
        <h3>Growth mindset</h3>
        <p>
            Going into the last point, don’t let failure discourage you. You will make mistakes, you will mix up words and sounds. That’s fine. Embrace the growth mindset. You might not be fluent in your target language now, but with time, you can and you will.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Notion/Google Sheets/Journal: </strong>something to help you track your progress, keep track of links etc. Notion can be daunting as a beginner however, so if you get stuck don’t feel you have to stick with it! You don’t need Notion to learn languages, it’s just a tool :)</li>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            <li><strong>CEFR Language Learning Benchmarks: </strong> the language learning benchmarks set by the CEFR or the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages can be useful in setting goals and measuring your proficiency!</li>
            <li><strong>Journal: </strong> for writing practice and/or keeping track of progress e.g noting down what you did today and how long you spent.</li>
            <li><strong>The internet</strong> (since you’re seeing this, I assume this is a non-issue, but if your internet is spotty, several resources can be downloaded or printed for offline learning)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Anki/Quizlet/Spreadsheet/your favorite flashcard app/physical flashcards: </strong>it’s helpful to make a personal flashcard/review sheet to help you review on the go. I prefer Anki because it makes use of spaced repetition (i.e. reviewing things periodically so you remember them longer). The PC version and the Android app are free, but for ios it’s $25.

        <h2 id="resources-tbc">How to Learn</h2>
        <div class="how-learnoverview">
            <p>Before we dive into resources, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
            <p>
                Each person is different and each person’s approach to language learning may differ from another person’s depending on many factors such as time, current ability, age, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before diving in, I suggest setting a 30-45 minute timer and picking 1-2 of the resources linked below and watching them all the way through. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After watching, reflect on what methods resonate with you and what you can incorporate into your life to meet your language goals. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Set your goals, make your plans. When will you learn everyday? How will you learn? Determine your <strong>bare minimum activity:</strong> what small activity can you do when you’re short on time/busy but still want to get some learning in? For me, it’s flashcards.

            </p>
            <p>
                If a video takes you to another, let it (as long as you don’t end up stuck in a rabbit hole for several hours). While it’s important to research, it’s also important not to obsess over finding the perfect advice or perfect roadmap. You’re not going to find one. What matters here is getting started, you can always adjust as you go.
            </p>

        <h3 id="general-activities">General language learning activities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Journal in your target language!</li>
            <li>Change social media app languages to your target language!</li>
            <li>Find “speaking in [insert your target language] for 24 hours” videos
            </li>
            <li>Find translations/dubs/subs of your favorite media in your target language
            </li>
            <li>Think/speak to yourself in your target language - set a 15 minute timer and just chat with yourself, no one there to judge you! If you feel too awkward, imagine you are incredibly fluent and just have fun with it
            </li>
            <li>Do 5 minutes of flashcards everyday!</li>
            <li>Read simple stories over and over</li>
            <li>Listen to your target language often, even if you don’t understand as it will help you get used to the pronunciations
            </li>
            <li>Take advantage of Google Translate! - make sure to give Google Translate context, not just isolated words. You can also practice speaking into Google Translate to see if it understands you or not, and listen to the pronunciations</li>
            <li>Get a grammar book/resource to reference and learn more as you tackle more complicated sentences and to answer your own questions!
            </li>

                        <li>Listening a lot and often - doesn’t matter if you don’t understand yet, get used to the sounds</li>
                        <li>Read over and over - kids often learn through stories
                        </li>
                        <li>Learn simple words- made a list of words she thought would be useful
